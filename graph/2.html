<h2>Connectivity</h2>

<h3>Graphs</h3>

<ul class="definition">
	<li>A <b>walk</b> in graph `G` is a finite sequence of edges of the
		form
		<span class="formula">
			`v_0 v_1, v_1 v_2, cdots, v_(m-1), v_m`,
			also denoted by
			`v_0 to v_1 to v_2 to cdots to v_m`,
		</span>
		in which any two consecutive edges are adjacent or identical.
		The number of edges in a walk is called its length.
	</li>
	<li>A <b>trail</b> is a walk in which all edges are distinct.</li>
	<li>A <b>path</b> is a walk in which all vertices are distinct
		(except, possibly, `v_0 = v_m`).
	</li>
	<li>A walk, path or trail is <b>closed</b> if `v_0 = v_m`, a closed
		path with at least one edge is a <b>cycle</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="definition">
	A graph is <b>connected</b> if and only if there is a path between
	each pair of vertices.
</p>

<p class="theorem">
	A graph `G` is bipartite if and only if every cycle of `G` (if exist)
	has even length. In other words, A bipartite graph has no odd length
	cycle.
</p>

<p class="theorem">
	Let `G` be a simple graph on `n` vertices. If `G` has `k` components,
	then the number `m` of edges of `G` satisfies
	<span class="formula">
		`n-k le m le (n-k)(n-k+1)//2`.
	</span>
</p>

<p>Let `k = 2`, it follows:</p>

<p class="corollary">
	Any simple graph with `n` vertices and more than `(n-1)(n-2)//2` edges
	is connected.
</p>

<h3>Menger theorems</h3>

<ul class="definition">
	In a graph `G`,
	<li>A <b>disconnecting set</b> is a set of edges whose removal
		increases the number of components of `G`.</li>
	<li>A <b>cutset</b> is a minimal disconnecting set.</li>
	<li>A <b>bridge</b> is a cutset which has only one edge.</li>
	If `G` is a connected graph, its <b>edge-connectivity</b> `lambda(G)`
	is the size of the smallest cutset in `G`.
	We say that `G` is <b>`k`-edge-connected</b> if `lambda(G) ge k`.
</ul>

<ul class="definition">
	<li>A <b>separating set</b> in a graph `G` is a set of
		vertices whose deletion increases the number of components of `G`.</li>
	<li>A <b>cut-vertex</b> is a separating set which contains only one
		vertex.</li>
	If `G` is connected and not a complete graph, its <b>(vertex)
	connectivity</b> `kappa(G)` is the size of the smallest separating
	set in `G`. We also say that `G` is <b>`k`-connected</b> if `kappa(G)
	ge k`.
</ul>

<ul class="theorem">
	(Menger, 1927)
	<li>A graph `G` is `k`-edge-connected if and only if any
		two distinct vertices of `G` are joined by at least `k` paths, no
		two of which have any edges in common.
	</li>
	<li>A graph `G` with at least `k+1` vertices is `k`-connected if and
		only if any two vertices of `G` are joined by at least `k` paths,
		no two of which have any other vertices in common.
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="theorem">
	If `G` is a connected graph, then
	<span class="formula">
		`kappa(G) le lambda(G) le delta(G)`,
	</span>
	where `delta(G)` is the smallest vertex-degree in `G`.
</p>

<p class="remark">
	There are striking and unexpected similarities between the properties
	of cycles and cutsets. The reasons will become clear in Chapter 7.
</p>

<h3>Digraphs</h3>

<p>Definitions of walks, trails, paths and cycles in digraphs are similar;
	note that although a trail cannot contain a given arc `vw` more than
	once, it can contain both `vw` and `wv`. for example,
	<span class="formula">
		`z to w to v to w to u`.
	</span>
</p>

<ul class="definition">
	<li>A digraph `D` is <b>connected</b> if it cannot be expressed as the
		union of two digraphs; this is equivalent to saying that the
		underlying graph of `D` is a connected graph.</li>
	<li>`D` is <b>strongly connected</b> if, for any two vertices `v` and
		`w` of `D`, there is a directed path from `v` to `w`.</li>
	Every strongly connected digraph is connected.
</ul>

<p class="definition">
	Define a graph `G` to be <b>orientable</b> if each edge of `G` can
	be directed so that the resulting degraph (an <b>orientation</b>)
	is strongly connected.
</p>

<p class="theorem">
	(H. E. Robbins) A connected graph `G` is orientable if and only if
	each edge of `G` lies in at least one cycle; that is to say, `G` has
	no bridge.
</p>

<h2>Eulerian graphs and digraphs</h2>

<h3>Eulerian graphs</h3>

<p class="definition">
	A connected graph `G` is <b>Eulerian</b> if there exists a closed
	trail (<b>Eulerian trail</b>) that includes every edge of `G`.
	A non-Eulerian graph `G` is <b>semi-Eulerian</b> if there exists a
	(non-closed) trail that includes every edge of `G`.
</p>

<p class="corollary">
	Any Eulerian graph is orientable, since we simply follow any Eulerian
	trail, directing the edges in the direction of the trail as we go.
</p>

<p class="lemma">
	If `G` is a graph in which the degree of each vertex is at least 2,
	then `G` contains a cycle.
</p>

<p class="theorem">
	(Euler, 1735) A connected graph `G` is Eulerian if and only if the
	degree of each vertex of `G` is even.
</p>

<p class="corollary">
	A connected graph is Eulerian if and only if its set of edges can be
	split up into edge-disjoint cycles (无公共边的圈).
</p>

<p class="corollary">
	A connected graph is semi-Eulerian if and only if it has exactly two
	vertices of odd degree.
</p>

<p class="remark">
	In a semi-Eulerian graph, any semi-Eulerian trail must have one vertex
	of odd degree as its initial vertex and the other as its final vertex.
	Note also that, by the handshaking lemma, a graph cannot have exactly
	one vertex of odd degree.
</p>

<ol class="algorithm">
	(Fleury) Let `G` be an Eulerian graph. Then the following
	construction is always possible, and produces an Eulerian trail of
	`G`.<br/>
	Start at any vertex `u` and traverse the edges in an arbitrary manner,
	subject only to the following rules:
	<li>erase the edges as they are traversed, and if any isolated
		vertices result, erase them too;
	</li>
	<li>at each stage, use a bridge only if there is no alternative.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Eulerian digraphs</h3>

<p class="definition">
	A strongly connected digraph `D` is <b>Eulerian</b> if there exists a
	closed directed trail (<b>Eulerian trail</b>) that includes every arc
	of `D`.
</p>

<p class="theorem">
	A strongly connected digraph `D` is Eulerian if and only if, for each
	vertex `v` of `D`,
	<span class="formula">
		`"outdeg"(v) = "indeg"(v)`.
	</span>
</p>

<h2>Hamiltonian graphs and digraphs</h2>

<p class="definition">
	A connected graph `G` is <b>Hamiltonian</b> if there exists a cycle
	(<b>Hamiltonian cycle</b>) passing exactly once through each vertex of
	`G`. A non-Hamiltonian graph is <b>semi-Hamiltonian</b> if there
	exists a path through every vertex.
</p>

<p class="theorem">
	(Ore, 1960) If `G` is a simple graph with `n` (`ge 3`) vertices, and
	if
	<span class="formula">
		`"deg"(v) + "deg"(w) ge n`
	</span>
	for each pair of non-adjacent vertices `v` and `w`, then `G` is
	Hamiltonian.
</p>

<p class="corollary">
	(Dirac, 1952) If `G` is a simple graph with `n` (`ge 3`) vertices, and
	if `"deg"(v) ge n//2` for each vertex `v`, then `G` is Hamiltonian.
</p>

<h3>Hamiltonian digraphs</h3>

<p class="theorem">
	Let `D` be a strongly connected digraph with `n` vertices.
	If `"outdeg"(v) ge n//2` and `"indeg"(v) ge n//2` for each vertex `v`,
	then `D` is Hamiltonian.
</p>

<ul class="theorem">
	If `T` is a tournament:
	<li>`T` is strongly connected `iff` `T` is Hamiltonian.</li>
	<li>`T` is not strongly connected `iff` `T` is semi-Hamiltonian.</li>
</ul>
