# note

This is a blog site of student notes, including subjects of:

> maths
> computer science
> physics (coming soon)

This site uses KaTeX/MathML for math rendering.(MathML is faster and is
available for Firefox and Safari, and KaTeX is good to go for all other
browsers that don't support MathML.
